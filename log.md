# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec 29, 2018 (Creating RESTful API with flask)


**Today's Progress**: Installed Flask and started creating a basic api

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](Not deployed yet)
